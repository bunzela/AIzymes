# AI.zymes

Welcome to the source code repository for **AI.zymes — a modular platform for evolutionary enzyme design**.

**AI.zymes** integrates a suite of state-of-the-art tools for enzyme engineering, including:
- 🛠️ **Protein design** (e.g. RosettaDesign, ProteinMPNN, LigandMPNN)  
- 🔮 **Structure prediction** (e.g. ESMFold, RosettaRelax, MD minimization)
- ⚡ **Electrostatic Catalysis** (e.g. FieldTools)

Built with modularity in mind, **AI.zymes** allows you to easily plug in new methods or customize workflows for diverse bioengineering goals — from enzyme evolution to structure-function exploration.

We are currently working on improving the accessibility of **AI.zymes**, including a full user manual and installation instructions. Stay tuned!
