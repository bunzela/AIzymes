# Requirements
Download and install Rosetta from the following link, and set ROSETTA_PATH to point to rosetta_XXX/main/source/
```
https://www.rosettacommons.org/software/license-and-download
```
ESMfold through HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/facebook/esmfold_v1)
```
pip install --upgrade transformers py3Dmol accelerate
```
ProteinMPNN might be used in the future and can be installed like this:
```
git clone https://github.com/dauparas/ProteinMPNN.git
pip install --upgrade transformers py3Dmol accelerate torch
```


To install everything necessary for AIzymes (except Rosetta) in a new conda environment (no ProteinMPNN) from Abbie:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
