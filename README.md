# AI.zymes  
*A Modular Platform for Evolutionary Enzyme Design*

Welcome to the source code repository for **AI.zymes** — a modular platform for evolutionary enzyme design.

**AI.zymes** integrates multiple tools for enzyme design, scoring, and structural prediction. It is designed with modularity in mind, making it easy to plug in new methods or tailor workflows for different design goals.

We are currently working on improving the accessibility of **AI.zymes**, including a full user manual and installation instructions. Stay tuned!
